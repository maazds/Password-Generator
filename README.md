# Password Generator using Streamlit

This repository contains a simple password generator built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications. The application allows users to generate secure and random passwords based on their preferences for the inclusion of numbers, lowercase and uppercase alphabets, and special characters.

## Features:

Generate Passwords: Users can specify the number of numbers, lowercase alphabets, uppercase alphabets, and special characters they want in their password. Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, a password is generated based on the user's input.

Password Strength: The generated passwords are designed to be strong and secure due to the random combination of various character types.

User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is created using Streamlit, providing a simple and intuitive way for users to customize and generate passwords.

Copy to Clipboard: Users can easily copy the generated password to their clipboard with the click of a button.

# Usage:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have Python and the required libraries (Streamlit) installed.

Run the script password_generator.py using the command: streamlit run password_generator.py.

A browser window will open with the password generator interface. Adjust the sliders to select the desired number of characters for each category.

Click the "Generate Password" button to generate a password according to your preferences.

The generated password will be displayed in a text area. You can click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the password for use.

# Note:

This password generator application is a simple example and should not be used for generating passwords for critical or sensitive systems. It serves as an educational tool and starting point for building more advanced password generators with enhanced security features. Always follow best practices for password security and consider using specialized libraries or services for generating passwords in production environments.
